# Homepage / Landing Page: Gasthof Roschitzhof

This specification details the design and functionality of the Gasthof Roschitzhof's homepage, serving as the primary entry point and the digital embodiment of the 'Alpine Modern' concept. Its core purpose is to immediately captivate visitors, convey the unique charm and offerings of the Gasthof, and guide users towards relevant information or direct actions.

## Structure and Content:

1.  **Full-Screen Ambient Video Loop Hero**: The top section will feature a dynamic, high-resolution ambient video loop showcasing the stunning Soboth landscape, captivating motorcycle routes, and delicious farm-to-table cuisine. This visual immersion immediately sets the 'Alpine Modern' tone and highlights key aspects of the Gasthof. A clear headline and sub-headline will overlay the video, reinforcing the tagline "Alpine Modern: Where Tradition Meets High-Performance Hospitality."

2.  **Dynamic Trust Bar**: Positioned subtly below the hero section, a translucent bar will display real-time information such as live ratings (e.g., from Steiermark.com or Yelp) and current opening hours. This builds immediate trust and provides essential, up-to-date information at a glance.

3.  **Primary & Secondary Call-to-Actions (CTAs)**: Prominently placed CTAs will encourage immediate engagement, such as "Book a Table" and "Stay Overnight," guiding users towards conversion goals.

4.  **'Choose Your Adventure' Card Grid**: Replacing traditional navigation, this section will present an intuitive grid of visually rich cards. Each card, featuring high-quality photography and concise micro-copy, will represent a key audience segment: 'Biker', 'Gourmand', and 'Family'. Clicking a card will lead users to dedicated pages tailored to their interests, streamlining navigation and personalization.

5.  **Social Proof Section**: A curated integration of Instagram feeds will showcase authentic guest experiences and the vibrant atmosphere of the Gasthof. This will be complemented by a testimonial slider featuring glowing reviews from various sources, further enhancing credibility and appeal.

6.  **Comprehensive Footer**: The footer will contain essential contact information, an embedded interactive map, relevant industry badges (e.g., Motorrad Friendly, Bio-Austria), and quick links to legal pages and social media.

## Design Principles:

*   **Visual First**: Prioritizing high-quality imagery and video to tell the Gasthof's story.
*   **Mobile-First**: Ensuring optimal display and interaction on all mobile devices, with a focus on 'Thumb Zone' navigation principles.
*   **Clear Pathways**: Guiding users intuitively through the site with clear CTAs and segmented navigation.
*   **Trust Building**: Integrating live data and social proof to establish credibility from the outset.
