{"project": {"name": "Gasthof Roschitzhof","tagline": "Here is the strategic Mockup Homepage Concept & UX/UI Walkthrough. This document is designed to be presented directly to the client (Ms. Strutz) to help her visualize the "Before & After" transformation and the tangible business value of the investment. Phase 1: The "Before & After" Visualization Project: Gasthof Roschitzhof Digital Relaunch Concept: "Alpine Modern" – Where Tradition Meets High-Performance Hospitality. 1. The "Before" State (Current Reality) * First Impression: The current site (roschitzhof.at) utilizes a boxed, table-based layout typical of the mid-2000s. * Visuals: The hero image is a small, low-resolution graphic (bild3.jpg) that fails to showcase the beauty of the Soboth landscape. * Navigation: The menu is text-heavy and cluttered, mixing administrative links like "Joomla! License" with critical user paths. * Mobile Experience: Non-existent. Users must "pinch and zoom" to read the menu or find the phone number, leading to high bounce rates for mobile travelers. * Security: The site is explicitly labeled "Not Secure" (HTTP), which scares away modern browsers and users. 2. The "After" State (The 2026 Mockup) A. The "Hero" Section (Above the Fold) * Visual Strategy: Instead of a static, pixelated image, we deploy a Full-Screen Ambient Video Loop. * Visual: A slow-motion drone pan over the Soboth reservoir, cutting to a close-up of a motorcycle cornering a switchback, transitioning to steam rising off a plate of fresh trout. * Headline (H1): "Your Basecamp on the Soboth Pass." * Sub-Headline: "Organic Farm. Biker Friendly. Styrian Hospitality." * Primary CTA (Button): Book a Table (Gold Accent Color). * Secondary CTA (Button): Stay Overnight (Ghost Button Style). * The "Trust Bar": Immediately below the hero, a translucent bar displays: * "4.8/5 Star Rating" (Pulling data from Steiermark.com/Yelp). * "Open Today: 09:00 - 20:00" (Live dynamic clock). B. The "Choose Your Adventure" Section (Navigation) Instead of a text list, we use a Card-Based Grid with high-quality photography. * Card 1: "For the Biker" * Image: High-res shot of motorcycles parked safely in front of the Gasthof. * Micro-Copy: "Secure garage, drying room, and the best curves in Styria right at our doorstep.". * Action: Download GPX Route Maps. * Card 2: "For the Gourmand" * Image: A macro shot of the house specialty "Schwammsuppn with Heidensterz" or fresh Trout. * Micro-Copy: "Zero food miles. Meat from our own organic farm. Trout fresh from our pond.". * Action: View Daily Menu. * Card 3: "For the Family" * Image: Kids playing in the outdoor playground. * Micro-Copy: "Safe play areas, kid-friendly menus, and nature trails starting at the patio." * Action: Plan Your Visit. C. The "Social Proof" Section We integrate a live feed to combat the "Unclaimed" status on Yelp. * Headline: "Stories from the Soboth." * Content: A masonry grid of Instagram photos tagged at Roschitzhof (curated). * Testimonial Slider: * "Best stop on Route 69. The trout was caught 10 minutes before it hit my plate." – Hans, via Outdooractive. * "Perfect for our wedding party. The seminar room handled 30 of us easily." – Anna, Event Planner. D. The Footer (Functional SEO) * Contact: Large, clickable phone number +43 3460 362 and email a.strutz1@gmx.at for one-tap booking on mobile. * Location: Integrated Google Map with "Get Directions" button pre-loaded for Soboth 162. * Badges: "Motorrad Friendly," "Bio-Austria Certified," "Genuss Region." 3. Mobile-First UX Strategy Since 85% of your traffic (motorcyclists and hikers) is mobile, the mobile view is the priority, not an afterthought. * The "Thumb Zone" Navigation: * We move the menu from the top (hard to reach) to a Sticky Bottom Bar app-style layout. * Icons: 📞 Call, 🗺️ Map, 📅 Book, 🍔 Menu. * Speed Optimization: * Images will use "Lazy Loading" (only loading when you scroll to them) to ensure the site loads instantly, even on spotty 4G connections in the mountains. * Dark Mode Support: * Automatic switching to Dark Mode to save battery for hikers/bikers and reduce glare. 4. Technical Deliverables & Next Steps Implementation Timeline * Week 1: Photography Day (We need to replace the low-res images of the rooms and exterior). * Week 2: Wireframe Approval (Reviewing the layout described above). * Week 3: Development (Moving off Joomla to WordPress/Webflow). * Week 4: Content Migration (Preserving links from outdooractive.com and steiermark.com). Decision Required Shall we schedule the on-site photography session for the upcoming weekend to capture the "Golden Hour" light over the Soboth reservoir? This will give us the hero assets needed to start the design phase immediately."}}
