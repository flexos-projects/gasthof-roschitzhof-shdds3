## 1. Introduction

Gasthof Roschitzhof is a cornerstone of Styrian hospitality on the Soboth Pass, offering an authentic experience rooted in its organic farm and biker-friendly culture. However, its digital presence is a relic of a bygone era, failing to communicate this value to a modern, mobile-first audience. This document outlines the strategic vision for the Gasthof Roschitzhof Digital Relaunch, a project designed to transform its online identity from an outdated brochure into a high-performance, immersive digital experience we call "Alpine Modern."

## 2. The Problem: A Digital Relic

The current website, roschitzhof.at, is actively undermining the business. It presents a significant barrier to potential customers, particularly the 85% of visitors who are mobile users like motorcyclists and hikers.

*   **First Impression Failure:** The site utilizes a boxed, table-based layout from the mid-2000s with a small, low-resolution hero image (`bild3.jpg`). This immediately signals a lack of investment and modernity, creating a jarring disconnect with the high-quality, real-world experience the Gasthof provides.
*   **Mobile Hostility:** The site is not responsive. Mobile users must pinch and zoom to navigate, read menus, or find the phone number. This frustrating experience leads to extremely high bounce rates and lost revenue opportunities from travelers on the go.
*   **Lack of Trust:** Modern browsers flag the site as "Not Secure" due to its HTTP protocol. This warning actively deters users who are increasingly conscious of online security, especially when considering making bookings or inquiries.
*   **Cluttered Navigation:** The menu structure is illogical, mixing critical user paths with administrative links like "Joomla! License." It fails to guide users to the information they need, such as the daily menu or biker amenities.

## 3. The Solution: Alpine Modern

Our vision is to create a digital flagship that embodies the concept of "Alpine Modern" – where tradition meets high-performance hospitality. This solution is not merely a facelift but a complete strategic overhaul designed to drive business goals.

*   **Immersive Visuals:** We will replace the static homepage with a full-screen ambient video loop showcasing the soul of the Roschitzhof: a drone shot over the Soboth reservoir, a motorcycle carving a corner, and steam rising from a plate of fresh trout. This creates an immediate emotional connection and communicates the experience before the user reads a single word.
*   **Persona-Driven Navigation:** The cluttered menu will be replaced with a "Choose Your Adventure" card-based system. This allows users to self-identify—as a Biker, a Gourmand, or a Family—and be directed to a curated experience tailored to their needs. This is detailed further in the [Features Document](.flexos/docs/core/002-features.md).
*   **Mobile-First Experience:** We will prioritize the mobile view, implementing a "Thumb Zone" sticky bottom navigation bar with icons for core actions (Call, Map, Book, Menu). Performance will be paramount, with lazy loading for images and dark mode support to cater to travelers with limited battery and connectivity.
*   **Building Instant Trust:** A dynamic "Trust Bar" will display live data, pulling a 4.8/5 star rating from external sources and showing the current opening hours. This is reinforced by a "Social Proof" section with curated Instagram posts and authentic testimonials, transforming the website into a living, breathing entity.

## 4. Target Audience

Our design and functionality are laser-focused on the following personas:

*   **The Motorcyclist (Hans, 45):** Travels on two wheels, often in groups. He uses his phone mounted on his handlebars for navigation and discovery. He needs quick access to downloadable GPX routes, confirmation of secure parking, and an easy way to book a table for his group. The [Biker's Hub Page](.flexos/docs/core/003-pages.md) will be his primary destination.
*   **The Local Gourmand (Anna, 32):** Lives within a 50km radius and is looking for an authentic farm-to-table dining experience. She wants to see the daily menu, learn about the organic sourcing, and book a table for a special occasion seamlessly from her phone.
*   **The Hiking Family (The Schmidts):** Planning a weekend trip to the Soboth region. They need to know about family-friendly amenities, safe play areas for their children, and nearby nature trails. They value clear information and high-quality photos that help them envision their trip.

By addressing the specific needs of these groups, we create a digital experience that feels personal, efficient, and valuable, directly translating into increased engagement and bookings.
